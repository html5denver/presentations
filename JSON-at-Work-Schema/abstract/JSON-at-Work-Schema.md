JSON at Work: Schema
====================

## Description
Most modern Web APIs prefer JSON because of its interoperability. All modern languages have excellent JSON support, but large-scale environments often require more than simple serialization/de-serialization. This tutorial shows how to leverage JSON Schema along with simple tooling to enhance a developerâ€™s workflow to build elegant, powerful, and efficient applications.

## Abstract
Most front-end developers interact with JSON by making an AJAX call and processing the results. Backend developers wrestle with serializing/de-serializing objects to/from JSON. But JSON has so much more to offer to Developers and Architects to help design and build large-scale systems of APIs.

This talk shows how to leverage JSON Schema to define the structure and format of JSON documents exchanged between applications:
* Why JSON Schema?
* How Does a JSON Schema help?
* The current state of the JSON Schema standard
* JSON Schema Basics
* JSON Schema Tooling

## What Do I Get Out of It?
This session will show practical JSON Schema development workflows, tools, and techniques to improve overall application design.

## Prerequisites
Prerequisites include:
* Prior knowledge of JavaScript and familiarity with JSON and Node.js.
* Familiarity with XML Schema or other schema languages.
