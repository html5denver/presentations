JSON in JavaScript and HTML5
============================

## Description
As a Developer or Architect, you're familiar with the basics of the JSON data interchange format, and in this talk we'll begin to develop applications with JSON, JavaScript, and HTML5. 

## Abstract
Since JSON began as a subset of JavaScript, this is where our real journey begins. In our examples, we'll leverage Node.js, scaffold a web application with Yeoman, and invoke a stub RESTful API that contains sample data. That's a lot of moving pieces and parts, so we'll iteratively build on each concept. 

Here's what we'll cover:
* JavaScript Serialization/De-serialization with `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`.
* JavaScript Objects and JSON.
* HTML5 Local/Session Storage and JSON.
* Building a small JSON-based web application.

## What Do I Get Out of It?
This session will show practical JSON-based development workflows, tools, and techniques to improve overall application design.

## Prerequisites
Prior knowledge of JavaScript and familiarity with JSON and Node.js.
