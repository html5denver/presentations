JSON at Work: Schema
====================

## Description
Most modern Web APIs prefer JSON because of its interoperability. All modern languages have excellent JSON support, but large-scale environments often require more than simple serialization/de-serialization. This tutorial shows how to leverage JSON Schema along with simple tooling to enhance a developer’s workflow to build elegant, powerful, and efficient applications.

## Abstract
Most front-end developers interact with JSON by making an AJAX call and processing the results. Backend developers wrestle with serializing/de-serializing objects to/from JSON. But JSON has so much more to offer to Developers and Architects to help design and build large-scale systems of APIs.

This talk shows how to leverage JSON Schema to define the structure and format of JSON documents exchanged between applications:
* Why JSON Schema?
* How Does a JSON Schema help?
* The current state of the JSON Schema standard
* JSON Schema Basics
* JSON Schema Tooling

But well-structured JSON documents aren’t always enough. Sometimes consuming applications only want to access a portion of an API’s JSON response. There are several ways to search through a JSON document, including: JSONPath, jsoniq, and JSON Pointer.

Sometimes an API Consumer may need to change the JSON data returned by an API. There are a couple techniques to modify a JSON document, including: JSON Transform and JSON Patch.

Example code will leverage JavaScript and Node.js.

This session will show practical JSON-based development workflows, tools, and techniques to improve overall application design.
